What's this game ? It's not so simple (Yeah, the temporary project title is a joke...).

It is a mix of a sideways 2D platformer, top-down exploration game, hopefully with major RPG elements like a proper turn-based battle system, and more stuff.

Blablabla I don't know what else to write.

## Controls

Escape : temporary ugly menu, for now solely for changing characters (first square : Adnyropast, second : Haple, third : Ten) (Escape to leave the menu, Enter to change character on the proper square)

Left arrow, A, Q : Left

Up arrow, W, Z : Up (use to enter doors)

Right arrow, D : Right

Down arrow, S : Down (also regenerates more energy, and allows characters to go through certain platforms)

Space : Jump

E : Battle engage move (drags characters in a turn-based battle system, barely started working on it)

I : Boomerang attack (Adnyropast, Haple)

O : Sword slash (Adnyropast, Haple)

P : Punch projectile (Adnyropast, Haple)

P : Other projectile (Adnyropast, Ten)

F : Flurry attack (Adnyropast, Haple)
