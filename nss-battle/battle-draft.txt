Pre-action strategy
- All characters choose a move
- Moves executed in order by speed
- e.g. Pokémon, Earthbound, Bravely Default / Second

In-action
- Characters choose a move that is executed right afterwards, in order by speed
- e.g. Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, Octopath Traveler

// 

Whoever needs to play picks their move.
- everyone
- only one character

Everyone has picked their move.

All these characters play in order of speed.
- everyone
- only one character

The next people will then play.
- everyone
- the next character in the speed order

// Example

battlers = [haple = {spd : 10}, ten = {spd : 9}, nao1 = {spd : 5}, nao2 = {spd : 7}];

GENERAL SYSTEM

- beginning of the turn
- group has to play
- everyone in the group adds their move(s) to a list
- group is ready → the turn can start
- moves are executed in order of priority (depends on the moves and their users)
- end of the turn



a "turn" would be a playing turn for a group of characters ; can be everyone, can be only one character (maybe multiple but not all of them ?). If there is a total of n fighters, the game picks for the group either the n or 1 fastest fighter(s)
the game waits for everyone in the group to be ready. All these characters pick one or more moves and adds them to a list of moves that are going to be used this turn.
when everyone is ready, the game executes all the moves depending on their priority (determined by the move itself and the speed of the user)

// Mechanics to implement

Character conditions for x turns
Stage conditions for x turns
Damage roll
Turn-skipping stun
